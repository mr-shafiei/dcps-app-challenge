    <p>PARCC tests assess Common Core State Standards in reading and math to students in third to eighth grades, as well as high school students in Algebra, Geometry, and English I and II. To prepare for the new exam, DCPS invested over $3 million to make significant technology upgrades. The majority of the investments were spent on upgrading and purchasing new technology, as well as retrofitting facilities to increase bandwidth and other needs. DCPS also provided regular trainings to school staff.</p>
